# A solution for the TSP using genetic algorithm.

The Traveling Salesman Problem (PCV) is a problem that tries to determine the shortest route to travel through a series of cities (visiting each one only once), returning to the city of origin.

A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search technique used in computer science to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems, they are a particular class of evolutionary algorithms that use techniques inspired by evolutionary biology such as heredity, mutation, natural selection, and recombination (or crossing over).

## Run
To download the algorithm, just have Git installed and run the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/vannisson/genetic-algorithm-tsp.git```

To run the algorithm it is necessary to install some libraries beforehand, such as Numpy and Matplotlib. To install them just run the following command:

``` $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```

After that, all you need to do is run the `main.py` file.
